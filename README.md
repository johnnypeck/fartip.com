FARTIP

<ul>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Reliability & Safety</li>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Inclusiveness</li>
<li>Privacy & Security</li>
</ul>

These are Microsoft's Six Principles of Responsible Artificial Intelligence but they had them in the
wrong order. I fixed it.

I wanted an easier thing to remember than FRPITA whilst studying their machine learning and Azure documentation.

So, FARTIP. A better FRPITA. Pretty surprised the domain was available. Stunned, really.

Your welcome.
